# Sonancia

The code presented here consists of the code used for the procedural generation of levels and their soundscapes for the game Sonancia. All code presented here was implemented by myself during my PhD thesis. Gameplay footage of Sonancia is available at http://phil-lopes.com/research/.

To make this code work it is necessary to have the AIPathfindingProject and Underground Cathedral Unity Assets. As these are specifically paid assets, I have not included them within the code.
